> [!NOTE]
> Schema Markup is a type of microdata that helps search engines understand the structure and content of a webpage. Here are some of the most commonly used Schema Markup tags:

## General Tags:

1. **@context**: Specifies the context of the schema markup, such as "https://schema.org".
2. **@type**: Specifies the type of entity being described, such as "Organization", "Person", or "Product".
3. **@id**: Specifies a unique identifier for the entity being described.

```html
<title>Example Website)</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "name": "Example Website",
    "description": "This is an example website."
  }
</script>
```

> [!TIPS] General Tips
>
> - Use the correct schema.org vocabulary and properties for your specific use case.
> - Use the `@context` property to specify the schema.org vocabulary.
> - Use the `@type` property to specify the type of schema markup (e.g. `WebPage`, `Organization`, `Event`, etc.).
> - Use the `name` property to specify the name of the schema markup.
> - Use the `description` property to specify a brief description of the schema markup.

> [!QUESTION] Asked AI:
> Would the description property be the same as t he meta tag description?
> The `description` property in schema markup and the `meta` tag description are related but not exactly the same.

> [!important] Meta Tag Description

The `meta` tag description is a brief summary of the page's content, typically used by search engines to display in search engine results pages (SERPs). It's usually a short sentence or phrase that summarizes the page's content. The `meta` tag description is typically used for:

- Search engine optimization (SEO)
- Social media sharing
- Browser title bars

> [!important] Best practice

Use both the `meta` tag description and the schema markup description to provide a comprehensive understanding of your page's content. The `meta` tag description should be a brief summary of the page's content, while the schema markup description should provide more detailed context about the entity being described.

> [!important] Key differences

- Length: Schema markup descriptions can be longer than `meta` tag descriptions.
- Purpose: Schema markup descriptions are used for entity understanding and disambiguation, while `meta` tag descriptions are used for SEO and social media sharing.
- Content: Schema markup descriptions should provide more context about the entity being described, while `meta` tag descriptions should summarize the page's content.

> [!important] Schema Markup Description

The `description` property in schema markup is a more detailed description of the entity being described, such as a product, event, or organization. It's intended to provide more context about the entity, rather than just a brief summary. The schema markup description is typically used for:

- Entity understanding and disambiguation
- Rich snippets and featured snippets
- Structured data and knowledge graphs

While both descriptions are used to provide context about the page's content, the schema markup description is more detailed and focused on the entity being described, whereas the `meta` tag description is more focused on summarizing the page's content.

> [!important] Here's an example:

- `meta` tag description: "Learn about our company and services."
- Schema markup description: "Our company is a leading provider of innovative solutions for the healthcare industry. We offer a range of services, including consulting, training, and software development."

By using both descriptions, you can provide a more comprehensive understanding of your page's content and improve your search engine rankings and entity understanding.
