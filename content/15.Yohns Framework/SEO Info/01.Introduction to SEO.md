**<body> tags:**

5. **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Ensure your website is responsive and provides a good user experience on mobile devices.
6. **Page Speed Optimization**: Optimize your website's loading speed to improve user experience and search engine rankings.
7. **Content Quality and Quantity**: Focus on creating high-quality, engaging, and informative content that addresses your target audience's needs.

10. **Accessibility Features**: Implement accessibility features, such as ARIA attributes, to ensure your website is usable by people with disabilities.
