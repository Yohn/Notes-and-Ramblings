The research I've seen shows users generally focus on several key customization areas, in rough order of importance:

--- start-multi-column: UserPreferences

```column-settings
	- number of columns: 2
	- border: off
```

## 1. Visual Identity

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Colors (which you've already started with backgrounds/gradients)
> - Typography (font choices, sizes, spacing)
> - Brand elements (logos, headers, custom images)
> - Layout spacing and padding
> - Visual hierarchy through sizing and positioning

## 2. Content Organization

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Section arrangement/ordering
> - Column layouts
> - Content blocks grouping
> - White space management
> - Mobile layout preferences

--- end-column ---

## 3. Interactive Elements

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Button styles and behaviors
> - Menu/navigation presentation
> - Form styling
> - Social media integration points
> - Hover/click effects

## 4. Media Handling

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Image placement and sizing
> - Video embedding options
> - Gallery/carousel presentations
> - Background media (images/videos)
> - Media optimization preferences

--- end-multi-column

## Some interesting findings from user behavior studies:

- Most users prefer drag-and-drop interfaces over property panels
- Users often start with colors and typography before layout
- Many users want to see mobile preview while editing
- Users prefer immediate visual feedback over saving/preview modes
- Undo/redo functionality is heavily used and expected

Given you're using Bootstrap 5.3.3, we could leverage its utility classes and components while making them accessible through an intuitive interface. Would you like to dig deeper into any of these areas before you share your code?
