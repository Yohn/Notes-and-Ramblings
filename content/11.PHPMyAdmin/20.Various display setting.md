## Various display setting[¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#various-display-setting "Permalink to this headline")

##### `$cfg['RepeatCells']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_RepeatCells "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | integer |
| Default value: | 100     |

Repeat the headers every X cells, or 0 to deactivate.

##### `$cfg['QueryHistoryDB']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_QueryHistoryDB "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

##### `$cfg['QueryHistoryMax']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_QueryHistoryMax "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | integer |
| Default value: | 25      |

If [`$cfg['QueryHistoryDB']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_QueryHistoryDB) is set to `true`, all your Queries are logged to a table, which has to be created by you (see [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['history']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_history)). If set to false, all your queries will be appended to the form, but only as long as your window is opened they remain saved.

When using the JavaScript based query window, it will always get updated when you click on a new table/db to browse and will focus if you click on Edit SQL after using a query. You can suppress updating the query window by checking the box Do not overwrite this query from outside the window below the query textarea. Then you can browse tables/databases in the background without losing the contents of the textarea, so this is especially useful when composing a query with tables you first have to look in. The checkbox will get automatically checked whenever you change the contents of the textarea. Please uncheck the button whenever you definitely want the query window to get updated even though you have made alterations.

If [`$cfg['QueryHistoryDB']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_QueryHistoryDB) is set to `true` you can specify the amount of saved history items using [`$cfg['QueryHistoryMax']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_QueryHistoryMax).

##### `$cfg['BrowseMIME']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_BrowseMIME "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Enable [Transformations](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/transformations.html#transformations).

##### `$cfg['MaxExactCount']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_MaxExactCount "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | integer |
| Default value: | 50000   |

For InnoDB tables, determines for how large tables phpMyAdmin should get the exact row count using `SELECT COUNT`. If the approximate row count as returned by `SHOW TABLE STATUS` is smaller than this value, `SELECT COUNT` will be used, otherwise the approximate count will be used.

Changed in version 4.8.0: The default value was lowered to 50000 for performance reasons.

Changed in version 4.2.6: The default value was changed to 500000.

##### `$cfg['MaxExactCountViews']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_MaxExactCountViews "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | integer |
| Default value: | 0       |

For VIEWs, since obtaining the exact count could have an impact on performance, this value is the maximum to be displayed, using a `SELECT COUNT ... LIMIT`. Setting this to 0 bypasses any row counting.

##### `$cfg['NaturalOrder']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_NaturalOrder "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Sorts database and table names according to natural order (for example, t1, t2, t10). Currently implemented in the navigation panel and in Database view, for the table list.

|                |            |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Type:          | string     |
| Default value: | `'closed'` |

If set to `'closed'`, the visual sliders are initially in a closed state. A value of `'open'` does the reverse. To completely disable all visual sliders, use `'disabled'`.

##### `$cfg['UserprefsDisallow']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_UserprefsDisallow "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | array   |
| Default value: | array() |

Contains names of configuration options (keys in `$cfg` array) that users can’t set through user preferences. For possible values, refer to classes under `libraries/classes/Config/Forms/User/`.

##### `$cfg['UserprefsDeveloperTab']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_UserprefsDeveloperTab "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |
