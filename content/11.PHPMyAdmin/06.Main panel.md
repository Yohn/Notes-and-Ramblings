## Main panel[¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#main-panel "Permalink to this headline")

##### `$cfg['ShowStats']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_ShowStats "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Defines whether or not to display space usage and statistics about databases and tables. Note that statistics requires at least MySQL 3.23.3 and that, at this date, MySQL doesn’t return such information for Berkeley DB tables.

##### `$cfg['ShowServerInfo']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_ShowServerInfo "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Defines whether to display detailed server information on main page. You can additionally hide more information by using [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_verbose).

##### `$cfg['ShowPhpInfo']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_ShowPhpInfo "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Defines whether to display the PHP information or not at the starting main (right) frame.

Please note that to block the usage of `phpinfo()` in scripts, you have to put this in your `php.ini`:

disable_functions = phpinfo()

Warning

Enabling phpinfo page will leak quite a lot of information about server setup. Is it not recommended to enable this on shared installations.

This might also make easier some remote attacks on your installations, so enable this only when needed.

##### `$cfg['ShowChgPassword']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_ShowChgPassword "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Defines whether to display the Change password link or not at the starting main (right) frame. This setting does not check MySQL commands entered directly.

Please note that enabling the Change password link has no effect with config authentication mode: because of the hard coded password value in the configuration file, end users can’t be allowed to change their passwords.

##### `$cfg['ShowCreateDb']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_ShowCreateDb "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Defines whether to display the form for creating database or not at the starting main (right) frame. This setting does not check MySQL commands entered directly.

##### `$cfg['ShowGitRevision']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_ShowGitRevision "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Defines whether to display information about the current Git revision (if applicable) on the main panel.

##### `$cfg['MysqlMinVersion']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_MysqlMinVersion "Permalink to this definition")

|       |       |
| ----- | ----- |
| Type: | array |

Defines the minimum supported MySQL version. The default is chosen by the phpMyAdmin team; however this directive was asked by a developer of the Plesk control panel to ease integration with older MySQL servers (where most of the phpMyAdmin features work).
