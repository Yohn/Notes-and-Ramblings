## Server connection settings[¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#server-connection-settings "Permalink to this headline")

##### `$cfg['Servers']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Type:          | array                                       |
| Default value: | one server array with settings listed below |

Since version 1.4.2, phpMyAdmin supports the administration of multiple MySQL servers. Therefore, a [`$cfg['Servers']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers)-array has been added which contains the login information for the different servers. The first [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_host) contains the hostname of the first server, the second [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_host) the hostname of the second server, etc. In `libraries/config.default.php`, there is only one section for server definition, however you can put as many as you need in `config.inc.php`, copy that block or needed parts (you don’t have to define all settings, just those you need to change).

Note

The [`$cfg['Servers']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers) array starts with $cfg[‘Servers’][1]. Do not use $cfg[‘Servers’][0]. If you want more than one server, just copy following section (including $i increment) several times. There is no need to define full server array, just define values you need to change.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_host "Permalink to this definition")

|                |               |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Type:          | string        |
| Default value: | `'localhost'` |

The hostname or [IP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ip) address of your $i-th MySQL-server. E.g. `localhost`.

Possible values are:

- hostname, e.g., `'localhost'` or `'mydb.example.org'`
- IP address, e.g., `'127.0.0.1'` or `'192.168.10.1'`
- IPv6 address, e.g. `2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652`
- dot - `'.'`, i.e., use named pipes on windows systems
- empty - `''`, disables this server

Note

The hostname `localhost` is handled specially by MySQL and it uses the socket based connection protocol. To use TCP/IP networking, use an IP address or hostname such as `127.0.0.1` or `db.example.com`. You can configure the path to the socket with [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_socket).

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_port "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

The port-number of your $i-th MySQL-server. Default is 3306 (leave blank).

Note

If you use `localhost` as the hostname, MySQL ignores this port number and connects with the socket, so if you want to connect to a port different from the default port, use `127.0.0.1` or the real hostname in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_host).

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_socket "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

The path to the socket to use. Leave blank for default. To determine the correct socket, check your MySQL configuration or, using the **mysql** command–line client, issue the `status` command. Among the resulting information displayed will be the socket used.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_ssl "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Whether to enable SSL for the connection between phpMyAdmin and the MySQL server to secure the connection.

When using the `'mysql'` extension, none of the remaining `'ssl...'` configuration options apply.

We strongly recommend the `'mysqli'` extension when using this option.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_key']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_ssl_key "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | NULL   |

Path to the client key file when using SSL for connecting to the MySQL server. This is used to authenticate the client to the server.

For example:

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_key'] = '/etc/mysql/server-key.pem';

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_cert']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_ssl_cert "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | NULL   |

Path to the client certificate file when using SSL for connecting to the MySQL server. This is used to authenticate the client to the server.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_ca']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_ssl_ca "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | NULL   |

Path to the CA file when using SSL for connecting to the MySQL server.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_ca_path']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_ssl_ca_path "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | NULL   |

Directory containing trusted SSL CA certificates in PEM format.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_ciphers']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_ssl_ciphers "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | NULL   |

List of allowable ciphers for SSL connections to the MySQL server.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_verify']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_ssl_verify "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

New in version 4.6.0: This is supported since phpMyAdmin 4.6.0.

If your PHP install uses the MySQL Native Driver (mysqlnd), your MySQL server is 5.6 or later, and your SSL certificate is self-signed, there is a chance your SSL connection will fail due to validation. Setting this to `false` will disable the validation check.

Since PHP 5.6.0 it also verifies whether server name matches CN of its certificate. There is currently no way to disable just this check without disabling complete SSL verification.

Warning

Disabling the certificate verification defeats purpose of using SSL. This will make the connection vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.

Note

This flag only works with PHP 5.6.16 or later.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_connect_type "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | string  |
| Default value: | `'tcp'` |

Deprecated since version 4.7.0: This setting is no longer used as of 4.7.0, since MySQL decides the connection type based on host, so it could lead to unexpected results. Please set [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_host) accordingly instead.

What type connection to use with the MySQL server. Your options are `'socket'` and `'tcp'`. It defaults to tcp as that is nearly guaranteed to be available on all MySQL servers, while sockets are not supported on some platforms. To use the socket mode, your MySQL server must be on the same machine as the Web server.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['compress']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_compress "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Whether to use a compressed protocol for the MySQL server connection or not (experimental).

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlhost']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_controlhost "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

Permits to use an alternate host to hold the configuration storage data.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlport']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_controlport "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

Permits to use an alternate port to connect to the host that holds the configuration storage.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_controluser "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_controlpass "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

This special account is used to access [phpMyAdmin configuration storage](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#linked-tables). You don’t need it in single user case, but if phpMyAdmin is shared it is recommended to give access to [phpMyAdmin configuration storage](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#linked-tables) only to this user and configure phpMyAdmin to use it. All users will then be able to use the features without need to have direct access to [phpMyAdmin configuration storage](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#linked-tables).

Changed in version 2.2.5: those were called `stduser` and `stdpass`

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['control_*']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_control_* "Permalink to this definition")

|       |       |
| ----- | ----- |
| Type: | mixed |

New in version 4.7.0.

You can change any MySQL connection setting for control link (used to access [phpMyAdmin configuration storage](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#linked-tables)) using configuration prefixed with `control_`.

This can be used to change any aspect of the control connection, which by default uses same parameters as the user one.

For example you can configure SSL for the control connection:

// Enable SSL
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['control_ssl'] = true;
// Client secret key
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['control_ssl_key'] = '../client-key.pem';
// Client certificate
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['control_ssl_cert'] = '../client-cert.pem';
// Server certification authority
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['control_ssl_ca'] = '../server-ca.pem';

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_auth_type "Permalink to this definition")

|                |            |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Type:          | string     |
| Default value: | `'cookie'` |

Whether config or cookie or [HTTP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-http) or signon authentication should be used for this server.

- ‘config’ authentication (`$auth_type = 'config'`) is the plain old way: username and password are stored in `config.inc.php`.
- ‘cookie’ authentication mode (`$auth_type = 'cookie'`) allows you to log in as any valid MySQL user with the help of cookies.
- ‘http’ authentication allows you to log in as any valid MySQL user via HTTP-Auth.
- ‘signon’ authentication mode (`$auth_type = 'signon'`) allows you to log in from prepared PHP session data or using supplied PHP script.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_http_realm']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_auth_http_realm "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

When using auth_type = `http`, this field allows to define a custom [HTTP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-http) Basic Auth Realm which will be displayed to the user. If not explicitly specified in your configuration, a string combined of “phpMyAdmin ” and either [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_verbose) or [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_host) will be used.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_swekey_config']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_auth_swekey_config "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

New in version 3.0.0.0: This setting was named $cfg[‘Servers’][$i][‘auth_feebee_config’] and was renamed before the 3.0.0.0 release.

Deprecated since version 4.6.4: This setting was removed because their servers are no longer working and it was not working correctly.

Deprecated since version 4.0.10.17: This setting was removed in a maintenance release because their servers are no longer working and it was not working correctly.

The name of the file containing swekey ids and login names for hardware authentication. Leave empty to deactivate this feature.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_user "Permalink to this definition")

|                |          |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Type:          | string   |
| Default value: | `'root'` |

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_password "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

When using [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_auth_type) set to ‘config’, this is the user/password-pair which phpMyAdmin will use to connect to the MySQL server. This user/password pair is not needed when [HTTP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-http) or cookie authentication is used and should be empty.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['nopassword']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_nopassword "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Deprecated since version 4.7.0: This setting was removed as it can produce unexpected results.

Allow attempt to log in without password when a login with password fails. This can be used together with http authentication, when authentication is done some other way and phpMyAdmin gets user name from auth and uses empty password for connecting to MySQL. Password login is still tried first, but as fallback, no password method is tried.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_only_db "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Type:          | string or array |
| Default value: | `''`            |

If set to a (an array of) database name(s), only this (these) database(s) will be shown to the user. Since phpMyAdmin 2.2.1, this/these database(s) name(s) may contain MySQL wildcards characters (“\_” and “%”): if you want to use literal instances of these characters, escape them (I.E. use `'my\_db'` and not `'my_db'`).

This setting is an efficient way to lower the server load since the latter does not need to send MySQL requests to build the available database list. But **it does not replace the privileges rules of the MySQL database server**. If set, it just means only these databases will be displayed but **not that all other databases can’t be used.**

An example of using more that one database:

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] = array('db1', 'db2');

Changed in version 4.0.0: Previous versions permitted to specify the display order of the database names via this directive.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['hide_db']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_hide_db "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

Regular expression for hiding some databases from unprivileged users. This only hides them from listing, but a user is still able to access them (using, for example, the SQL query area). To limit access, use the MySQL privilege system. For example, to hide all databases starting with the letter “a”, use

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['hide_db'] = '^a';

and to hide both “db1” and “db2” use

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['hide_db'] = '^(db1|db2)$';

More information on regular expressions can be found in the [PCRE pattern syntax](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php) portion of the PHP reference manual.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_verbose "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

Only useful when using phpMyAdmin with multiple server entries. If set, this string will be displayed instead of the hostname in the pull-down menu on the main page. This can be useful if you want to show only certain databases on your system, for example. For HTTP auth, all non-US-ASCII characters will be stripped.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_extension "Permalink to this definition")

|                |            |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Type:          | string     |
| Default value: | `'mysqli'` |

Deprecated since version 4.2.0: This setting was removed. The `mysql` extension will only be used when the `mysqli` extension is not available. As of 5.0.0, only the `mysqli` extension can be used.

The PHP MySQL extension to use (`mysql` or `mysqli`).

It is recommended to use `mysqli` in all installations.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

The name of the database containing the phpMyAdmin configuration storage.

See the [phpMyAdmin configuration storage](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#linked-tables) section in this document to see the benefits of this feature, and for a quick way of creating this database and the needed tables.

If you are the only user of this phpMyAdmin installation, you can use your current database to store those special tables; in this case, just put your current database name in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb). For a multi-user installation, set this parameter to the name of your central database containing the phpMyAdmin configuration storage.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_bookmarktable "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Type:          | string or false |
| Default value: | `''`            |

New in version 2.2.0.

Since release 2.2.0 phpMyAdmin allows users to bookmark queries. This can be useful for queries you often run. To allow the usage of this functionality:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage
- enter the table name in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_bookmarktable)

This feature can be disabled by setting the configuration to `false`.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_relation "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Type:          | string or false |
| Default value: | `''`            |

New in version 2.2.4.

Since release 2.2.4 you can describe, in a special ‘relation’ table, which column is a key in another table (a foreign key). phpMyAdmin currently uses this to:

- make clickable, when you browse the master table, the data values that point to the foreign table;
- display in an optional tool-tip the “display column” when browsing the master table, if you move the mouse to a column containing a foreign key (use also the ‘table_info’ table); (see [6.7 How can I use the “display column” feature?](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/faq.html#faqdisplay))
- in edit/insert mode, display a drop-down list of possible foreign keys (key value and “display column” are shown) (see [6.21 In edit/insert mode, how can I see a list of possible values for a column, based on some foreign table?](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/faq.html#faq6-21))
- display links on the table properties page, to check referential integrity (display missing foreign keys) for each described key;
- in query-by-example, create automatic joins (see [6.6 How can I use the relation table in Query-by-example?](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/faq.html#faq6-6))
- enable you to get a [PDF](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-pdf) schema of your database (also uses the table_coords table).

The keys can be numeric or character.

To allow the usage of this functionality:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage
- put the relation table name in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_relation)
- now as normal user open phpMyAdmin and for each one of your tables where you want to use this feature, click Structure/Relation view/ and choose foreign columns.

This feature can be disabled by setting the configuration to `false`.

Note

In the current version, `master_db` must be the same as `foreign_db`. Those columns have been put in future development of the cross-db relations.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_info']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_table_info "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Type:          | string or false |
| Default value: | `''`            |

New in version 2.3.0.

Since release 2.3.0 you can describe, in a special ‘table_info’ table, which column is to be displayed as a tool-tip when moving the cursor over the corresponding key. This configuration variable will hold the name of this special table. To allow the usage of this functionality:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage
- put the table name in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_info']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_table_info) (e.g. `pma__table_info`)
- then for each table where you want to use this feature, click “Structure/Relation view/Choose column to display” to choose the column.

This feature can be disabled by setting the configuration to `false`.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_table_coords "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |

The designer feature can save your page layout; by pressing the “Save page” or “Save page as” button in the expanding designer menu, you can customize the layout and have it loaded the next time you use the designer. That layout is stored in this table. Furthermore, this table is also required for using the PDF relation export feature, see [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pdf_pages) for additional details.

New in version 2.3.0.

Since release 2.3.0 you can have phpMyAdmin create [PDF](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-pdf) pages showing the relations between your tables. Further, the designer interface permits visually managing the relations. To do this it needs two tables “pdf_pages” (storing information about the available [PDF](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-pdf) pages) and “table_coords” (storing coordinates where each table will be placed on a [PDF](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-pdf) schema output). You must be using the “relation” feature.

To allow the usage of this functionality:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage
- put the correct table names in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_table_coords) and [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pdf_pages)

This feature can be disabled by setting either of the configurations to `false`.

| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

New in version 2.10.0: Since release 2.10.0 a Designer interface is available; it permits to visually manage the relations.

Deprecated since version 4.3.0: This setting was removed and the Designer table positioning data is now stored into [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_table_coords).

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_info']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_column_info "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Type:          | string or false |
| Default value: | `''`            |

New in version 2.3.0.

This part requires a content update! Since release 2.3.0 you can store comments to describe each column for each table. These will then be shown on the “printview”.

Starting with release 2.5.0, comments are consequently used on the table property pages and table browse view, showing up as tool-tips above the column name (properties page) or embedded within the header of table in browse view. They can also be shown in a table dump. Please see the relevant configuration directives later on.

Also new in release 2.5.0 is a MIME- transformation system which is also based on the following table structure. See [Transformations](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/transformations.html#transformations) for further information. To use the MIME- transformation system, your column_info table has to have the three new columns ‘mimetype’, ‘transformation’, ‘transformation_options’.

Starting with release 4.3.0, a new input-oriented transformation system has been introduced. Also, backward compatibility code used in the old transformations system was removed. As a result, an update to column_info table is necessary for previous transformations and the new input-oriented transformation system to work. phpMyAdmin will upgrade it automatically for you by analyzing your current column_info table structure. However, if something goes wrong with the auto-upgrade then you can use the SQL script found in `./sql/upgrade_column_info_4_3_0+.sql` to upgrade it manually.

To allow the usage of this functionality:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage
- put the table name in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_info']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_column_info) (e.g. `pma__column_info`)
- to update your PRE-2.5.0 Column_comments table use this: and remember that the Variable in `config.inc.php` has been renamed from `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_comments']` to [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_info']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_column_info)
  ALTER TABLE `pma__column_comments`
  ADD `mimetype` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL,
  ADD `transformation` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL,
  ADD `transformation_options` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL;
- to update your PRE-4.3.0 Column_info table manually use this `./sql/upgrade_column_info_4_3_0+.sql` SQL script.

This feature can be disabled by setting the configuration to `false`.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['history']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_history "Permalink to this definition")

New in version 2.5.0.

Since release 2.5.0 you can store your [SQL](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-sql) history, which means all queries you entered manually into the phpMyAdmin interface. If you don’t want to use a table-based history, you can use the JavaScript-based history.

Using that, all your history items are deleted when closing the window. Using [`$cfg['QueryHistoryMax']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_QueryHistoryMax) you can specify an amount of history items you want to have on hold. On every login, this list gets cut to the maximum amount.

The query history is only available if JavaScript is enabled in your browser.

To allow the usage of this functionality:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage

New in version 3.5.0.

Since release 3.5.0 you can show recently used tables in the navigation panel. It helps you to jump across table directly, without the need to select the database, and then select the table. Using [`$cfg['NumRecentTables']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_NumRecentTables) you can configure the maximum number of recent tables shown. When you select a table from the list, it will jump to the page specified in [`$cfg['NavigationTreeDefaultTabTable']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_NavigationTreeDefaultTabTable).

Without configuring the storage, you can still access the recently used tables, but it will disappear after you logout.

To allow the usage of this functionality persistently:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage

Since release 4.2.0 you can show a list of selected tables in the navigation panel. It helps you to jump to the table directly, without the need to select the database, and then select the table. When you select a table from the list, it will jump to the page specified in [`$cfg['NavigationTreeDefaultTabTable']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_NavigationTreeDefaultTabTable).

You can add tables to this list or remove tables from it in database structure page by clicking on the star icons next to table names. Using [`$cfg['NumFavoriteTables']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_NumFavoriteTables) you can configure the maximum number of favorite tables shown.

Without configuring the storage, you can still access the favorite tables, but it will disappear after you logout.

To allow the usage of this functionality persistently:

New in version 3.3.x.

Since release 3.3.x a tracking mechanism is available. It helps you to track every [SQL](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-sql) command which is executed by phpMyAdmin. The mechanism supports logging of data manipulation and data definition statements. After enabling it you can create versions of tables.

The creation of a version has two effects:

- phpMyAdmin saves a snapshot of the table, including structure and indexes.
- phpMyAdmin logs all commands which change the structure and/or data of the table and links these commands with the version number.

Of course you can view the tracked changes. On the Tracking page a complete report is available for every version. For the report you can use filters, for example you can get a list of statements within a date range. When you want to filter usernames you can enter \* for all names or you enter a list of names separated by ‘,’. In addition you can export the (filtered) report to a file or to a temporary database.

To allow the usage of this functionality:

- set up [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb) and the phpMyAdmin configuration storage
- put the table name in [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['tracking']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_tracking) (e.g. `pma__tracking`)

| Default value: | `''`   |

Sets the time zone used by phpMyAdmin. Leave blank to use the time zone of your database server. Possible values are explained at [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/time-zone-support.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/time-zone-support.html)

This is useful when your database server uses a time zone which is different from the time zone you want to use in phpMyAdmin.

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

Whether to allow root access. This is just a shortcut for the [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_AllowDeny_rules) below.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_AllowNoPassword "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Whether to allow logins without a password. The default value of `false` for this parameter prevents unintended access to a MySQL server with was left with an empty password for root or on which an anonymous (blank) user is defined.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_AllowDeny_order "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

If your rule order is empty, then [IP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ip) authorization is disabled.

If your rule order is set to `'deny,allow'` then the system applies all deny rules followed by allow rules. Access is allowed by default. Any client which does not match a Deny command or does match an Allow command will be allowed access to the server.

If your rule order is set to `'allow,deny'` then the system applies all allow rules followed by deny rules. Access is denied by default. Any client which does not match an Allow directive or does match a Deny directive will be denied access to the server.

If your rule order is set to `'explicit'`, authorization is performed in a similar fashion to rule order ‘deny,allow’, with the added restriction that your host/username combination **must** be listed in the _allow_ rules, and not listed in the _deny_ rules. This is the **most** secure means of using Allow/Deny rules, and was available in Apache by specifying allow and deny rules without setting any order.

Please also see [`$cfg['TrustedProxies']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_TrustedProxies) for detecting IP address behind proxies.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_AllowDeny_rules "Permalink to this definition")

|     |     |
| --- | --- |

|Type:|array of strings|
|Default value:|array()|

The general format for the rules is as such:

<'allow' | 'deny'> <username> [from] <ipmask>

If you wish to match all users, it is possible to use a `'%'` as a wildcard in the _username_ field.

There are a few shortcuts you can use in the _ipmask_ field as well (please note that those containing SERVER_ADDRESS might not be available on all webservers):

'all' -> 0.0.0.0/0
'localhost' -> 127.0.0.1/8
'localnetA' -> SERVER_ADDRESS/8
'localnetB' -> SERVER_ADDRESS/16
'localnetC' -> SERVER_ADDRESS/24

Having an empty rule list is equivalent to either using `'allow % from all'` if your rule order is set to `'deny,allow'` or `'deny % from all'` if your rule order is set to `'allow,deny'` or `'explicit'`.

For the [IP Address](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ip-address) matching system, the following work:

- `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (an exact [IP Address](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ip-address))
- `xxx.xxx.xxx.[yyy-zzz]` (an [IP Address](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ip-address) range)
- `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/nn` (CIDR, Classless Inter-Domain Routing type [IP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ip) addresses)

But the following does not work:

- `xxx.xxx.xxx.xx[yyy-zzz]` (partial [IP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ip) address range)

For [IPv6](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ipv6) addresses, the following work:

- `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx` (an exact [IPv6](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ipv6) address)
- `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:[yyyy-zzzz]` (an [IPv6](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ipv6) address range)
- `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx/nn` (CIDR, Classless Inter-Domain Routing type [IPv6](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ipv6) addresses)

But the following does not work:

- `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xx[yyy-zzz]` (partial [IPv6](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-ipv6) address range)

Examples:

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] = 'allow,deny';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] = array('allow bob from all');
// Allow only 'bob' to connect from any host

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] = 'allow,deny';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] = array('allow mary from 192.168.100.[50-100]');
// Allow only 'mary' to connect from host 192.168.100.50 through 192.168.100.100

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] = 'allow,deny';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] = array('allow % from 192.168.[5-6].10');
// Allow any user to connect from host 192.168.5.10 or 192.168.6.10

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] = 'allow,deny';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] = array('allow root from 192.168.5.50','allow % from 192.168.6.10');
// Allow any user to connect from 192.168.6.10, and additionally allow root to connect from 192.168.5.50

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['DisableIS']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_DisableIS "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Disable using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to retrieve information (use `SHOW` commands instead), because of speed issues when many databases are present.

Note

Enabling this option might give you a big performance boost on older MySQL servers.

##### `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['SignonScript']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_SignonScript "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

New in version 3.5.0.

Name of PHP script to be sourced and executed to obtain login credentials. This is alternative approach to session based single signon. The script has to provide a function called `get_login_credentials` which returns list of username and password, accepting single parameter of existing username (can be empty). See `examples/signon-script.php` for an example:

```php
/**
 * Single signon for phpMyAdmin
 *
 * This is just example how to use script based single signon with
 * phpMyAdmin, it is not intended to be perfect code and look, only
 * shows how you can integrate this functionality in your application.
 */

declare(strict_types=1);

// phpcs:disable Squiz.Functions.GlobalFunction

/**
 * This function returns username and password.
 *
 * It can optionally use configured username as parameter.
 *
 * @param string $user User name
 *
 * @return array
 */
function get_login_credentials($user)
{
    /* Optionally we can use passed username */
    if (! empty($user)) {
        return [
            $user,
            'password',
        ];
    }

    /* Here we would retrieve the credentials */
    return [
        'root',
        '',
    ];

| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

Name of session which will be used for signon authentication method. You should use something different than `phpMyAdmin`, because this is session which phpMyAdmin uses internally. Takes effect only if [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['SignonScript']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_SignonScript) is not configured.
