## Basic settings[¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#basic-settings "Permalink to this headline")

##### `$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_PmaAbsoluteUri "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

Changed in version 4.6.5: This setting was not available in phpMyAdmin 4.6.0 - 4.6.4.

Sets here the complete [URL](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-url) (with full path) to your phpMyAdmin installation’s directory. E.g. `https://www.example.net/path_to_your_phpMyAdmin_directory/`. Note also that the [URL](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-url) on most of web servers are case sensitive (even on Windows). Don’t forget the trailing slash at the end.

Starting with version 2.3.0, it is advisable to try leaving this blank. In most cases phpMyAdmin automatically detects the proper setting. Users of port forwarding or complex reverse proxy setup might need to set this.

A good test is to browse a table, edit a row and save it. There should be an error message if phpMyAdmin is having trouble auto–detecting the correct value. If you get an error that this must be set or if the autodetect code fails to detect your path, please post a bug report on our bug tracker so we can improve the code.

##### `$cfg['PmaNoRelation_DisableWarning']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_PmaNoRelation_DisableWarning "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Starting with version 2.3.0 phpMyAdmin offers a lot of features to work with master / foreign – tables (see [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_pmadb)).

If you tried to set this up and it does not work for you, have a look on the Structure page of one database where you would like to use it. You will find a link that will analyze why those features have been disabled.

If you do not want to use those features set this variable to `true` to stop this message from appearing.

##### `$cfg['AuthLog']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_AuthLog "Permalink to this definition")

|                |          |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Type:          | string   |
| Default value: | `'auto'` |

New in version 4.8.0: This is supported since phpMyAdmin 4.8.0.

Configure authentication logging destination. Failed (or all, depending on [`$cfg['AuthLogSuccess']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_AuthLogSuccess)) authentication attempts will be logged according to this directive:

`auto`

Let phpMyAdmin automatically choose between `syslog` and `php`.

`syslog`

`php`

Log into PHP error log.

`sapi`

Log into PHP SAPI logging.

`/path/to/file`

Any other value is treated as a filename and log entries are written there.

Note

When logging to a file, make sure its permissions are correctly set for a web server user, the setup should closely match instructions described in [`$cfg['TempDir']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_TempDir):

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |

##### `$cfg['TranslationWarningThreshold']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_TranslationWarningThreshold "Permalink to this definition")

##### `$cfg['SendErrorReports']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_SendErrorReports "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | string  |
| Default value: | `'ask'` |

Valid values are:

- `ask`
- `always`
- `never`

Sets the default behavior for JavaScript error reporting.

Whenever an error is detected in the JavaScript execution, an error report may be sent to the phpMyAdmin team if the user agrees.

The default setting of `'ask'` will ask the user everytime there is a new error report. However you can set this parameter to `'always'` to send error reports without asking for confirmation or you can set it to `'never'` to never send error reports.

This directive is available both in the configuration file and in users preferences. If the person in charge of a multi-user installation prefers to disable this feature for all users, a value of `'never'` should be set, and the [`$cfg['UserprefsDisallow']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_UserprefsDisallow) directive should contain `'SendErrorReports'` in one of its array values.

##### `$cfg['ConsoleEnterExecutes']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_ConsoleEnterExecutes "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

Setting this to `true` allows the user to execute queries by pressing Enter instead of Ctrl+Enter. A new line can be inserted by pressing Shift + Enter.

The behaviour of the console can be temporarily changed using console’s settings interface.

##### `$cfg['AllowThirdPartyFraming']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_AllowThirdPartyFraming "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Type:          | boolean\|string |
| Default value: | false           |

Setting this to `true` allows phpMyAdmin to be included inside a frame, and is a potential security hole allowing cross-frame scripting attacks or clickjacking. Setting this to ‘sameorigin’ prevents phpMyAdmin to be included from another document in a frame, unless that document belongs to the same domain.
