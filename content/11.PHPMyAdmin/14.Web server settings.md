## Web server settings[¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#web-server-settings "Permalink to this headline")

##### `$cfg['OBGzip']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_OBGzip "Permalink to this definition")

|                |                |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Type:          | string/boolean |
| Default value: | `'auto'`       |

Defines whether to use GZip output buffering for increased speed in [HTTP](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-http) transfers. Set to true/false for enabling/disabling. When set to ‘auto’ (string), phpMyAdmin tries to enable output buffering and will automatically disable it if your browser has some problems with buffering. IE6 with a certain patch is known to cause data corruption when having enabled buffering.

##### `$cfg['TrustedProxies']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_TrustedProxies "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | array   |
| Default value: | array() |

Lists proxies and HTTP headers which are trusted for [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_AllowDeny_order). This list is by default empty, you need to fill in some trusted proxy servers if you want to use rules for IP addresses behind proxy.

The following example specifies that phpMyAdmin should trust a HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR (`X-Forwarded-For`) header coming from the proxy 1.2.3.4:

$cfg['TrustedProxies'] = array('1.2.3.4' => 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR');

The [`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules']`](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_Servers_AllowDeny_rules) directive uses the client’s IP address as usual.

##### `$cfg['GD2Available']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_GD2Available "Permalink to this definition")

|                |          |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Type:          | string   |
| Default value: | `'auto'` |

Specifies whether GD >= 2 is available. If yes it can be used for MIME transformations. Possible values are:

- auto - automatically detect
- yes - GD 2 functions can be used
- no - GD 2 function cannot be used

##### `$cfg['CheckConfigurationPermissions']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_CheckConfigurationPermissions "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | true    |

We normally check the permissions on the configuration file to ensure it’s not world writable. However, phpMyAdmin could be installed on a NTFS filesystem mounted on a non-Windows server, in which case the permissions seems wrong but in fact cannot be detected. In this case a sysadmin would set this parameter to `false`.

##### `$cfg['LinkLengthLimit']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_LinkLengthLimit "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | integer |
| Default value: | 1000    |

Limit for length of [URL](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-url) in links. When length would be above this limit, it is replaced by form with button. This is required as some web servers ([IIS](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-iis)) have problems with long [URL](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-url) .

##### `$cfg['CSPAllow']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_CSPAllow "Permalink to this definition")

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Type:          | string |
| Default value: | `''`   |

Additional string to include in allowed script and image sources in Content Security Policy header.

This can be useful when you want to include some external JavaScript files in `config.footer.inc.php` or `config.header.inc.php`, which would be normally not allowed by [Content Security Policy](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/glossary.html#term-content-security-policy).

To allow some sites, just list them within the string:

$cfg['CSPAllow'] = 'example.com example.net';

New in version 4.0.4.

##### `$cfg['DisableMultiTableMaintenance']` [¶](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html#cfg_DisableMultiTableMaintenance "Permalink to this definition")

|                |         |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Type:          | boolean |
| Default value: | false   |

In the database Structure page, it’s possible to mark some tables then choose an operation like optimizing for many tables. This can slow down a server; therefore, setting this to `true` prevents this kind of multiple maintenance operation.
